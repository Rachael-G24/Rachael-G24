# About me


**Rachael-G24/Rachael-G24** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently sharpening my skills with Wireshark, Networking Fundamentals, and Windows PowerShell, all within my cybersecurity bootcamp with The Ohio State University.
- 🌱 I’m studying independently for the Linux Essentials exam through the Linux Professional Institute.
- 👯 I’m looking for repositories that contain simple Linux commands and scripts so that I may learn from others.
- 🤔 I’m also planning on taking the CompTIA Security+ exam when my bootcamp class ends in December.
- 📫 How to reach me: Do you have a LinkedIn page? You may find me at https://tinyurl.com/yhna7v25 - Let's connect!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I ride motorcycles and can spend way too much money at Cycle Gear if I'm not careful!
