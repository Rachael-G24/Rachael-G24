# About me



- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently sharpening my skills with Wireshark, Networking Fundamentals, and Windows PowerShell, all within my cybersecurity bootcamp with The Ohio State University.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m studying independently for the Linux Essentials exam through the Linux Professional Institute.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for repositories that contain simple Linux commands and scripts so that I may learn from others.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m also planning on taking the CompTIA Security+ exam when my bootcamp class ends in December.
